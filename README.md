### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Antoine Pepino, welcome to my GitHub.

Former chef, now a budding software developer!  In the midst of the pandemic, I renewed my old passion for coding and dedicated two years to learning the art of programming. This journey led me to enroll at Coding Dojo, where I built a solid foundation in full-stack development. I'm eager collaborate with innovative teams and deliver scalable solutions that drive business success.

Nowadays working as a key contributor for "GrapplingDummy", a team project focused on leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT for martial arts instruction (Currently private, available for demo).
