### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Antoine Pepino. I discovered a newfound passion for coding during the pandemic, and decided to change careers in 2022, finally graduating from Coding Dojo in December 2022. During this intensive bootcamp, I spent over 1000 hours learning the craft, going from "Hello World" to full CRUD applications, in 3 full stacks (Python/Flask, MERN, Java/Spring). 

Currently, I'm having fun teaching myself PHP in order to build a barcode scanner app that grabs item info and prices from websites such as eBay.

I am actively looking for a full-time position as a developer, and would love to continue honing my skills while providing scaleable solutions at your company. 

Please feel free to contact me at anthony.pepino1@gmail.com .
